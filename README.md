# Solver^3

A rubiks cube solver with only 3 servos. Designed in openscad.

Each printable part has its own file, such as arm.scad and frame.scad. Opening
these files by themselves with openscad will get you a renderable, printable part,
properly oriented and all.

To preview the whole assembly, open solver_3.scad.
